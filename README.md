This is a small experiment of building an AI music radio as a vintage 3D radio experience.
- You can **interact** with the radio model's buttons and knobs to change stations, and control the volume, bass, and tuning, mimicking the look and feel of a real radio.
- The audio output is processed with Web Audio API to add distortions and noise.
- A hash-based logic is used to determine the active track in each station so that all listeners get a **live** listening experience.
- Currently, the music library is small and static in nature, but the ability to have music generated dynamically should be possible to add.
- Music was generated using [ElevenLabs Music](https://elevenlabs.io/music)
